I made this small course in order to demonstrate about how Back-end and Front-end interacts with each other through API for my friend who is a Business Analyst.

- API using NodeJS + MySQL
- Front-end using Vue 3.
- Course content:
  + What is API?
  + What is Request and Response?
  + How Back-end retrieve data from Database
  + How Front-end using Response to render data
